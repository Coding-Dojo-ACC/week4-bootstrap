            <p>If you had asked me what the hardest part of battling a global pandemic would be, I would have never guessed teaching elementary school math. Me in 2019, If I could just have like a week with nothing to do and nowhere to go I could finally get this house clean and organized. Turns out that time was not the problem.

If there's one thing that scares me more than an apocalyptic end of the world, itâ€™s the possibility that if my kids fail at homeschooling they have to retake it.</p>
